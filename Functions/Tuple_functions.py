# 1.Python tuple program to create a list of tuples from a list having a number and its square in each tuple.
# Input = [4,6,3,8]
# Output = [ (4, 16), (6, 36), (3, 27), (8, 64) ]
tup=(4,5,3,8)





# 2.Python tuple program to create a tuple with 2 lists of data.
# Input lists:
# list1 = [4, 6, 8]
# list2 = [7, 1, 4]
# Output= ((4, 7), (6, 1), (8, 4))





# 3.Python tuple program to find the maximum value from a tuple.
# Input = (41, 15, 69, 55)
# Output = 69



# 4.Python tuple program to check whether an element exists in a tuple or not.




# 5.Python tuple program to find sum of elements in a tuple.
# Input:
# A=(4,6,2)
# Output:
# 12




# 6.Python tuple program to create a tuple having squares of the elements from the list.
# Input = [(1,5,7), (3,6)]
# Output = (1, 81, 25, 49, 36



# 7.Python tuple program to join tuples if the initial elements of the sub-tuple are the same.
# Input:
# [(3,6,7),(7,8,4),(7,3),(3,0,5)]
